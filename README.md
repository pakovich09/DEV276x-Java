# DEV276x-Java
This is the repo for Microsoft's DEV276x Java course modules' projects. 
In total there are 4 projects: "Trip planner", "Odds and Evens", "Crypto" and final project "Maze runner".

# Module 1: Trip planner
Write a program that asks the user for some information about an international trip they are taking. Based on that information you will need to do some conversions, using the correct data types, to tell them some information to help them plan their trip.
To calculate the distance to their destanation, I have used Haversine formula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).
# Module 2: Odds and Evens
Here we have to code a game called "odds and evens". The game is similar to rock paper scissors. It is played between two players, in my version it is you versus the computer. Each player will choose either "odds" or "evens", since youâ€™re playing against computer you will get first pick. Once you have chosen your side, you each choose a number of fingers to play- 0 to 5. The winner is determined by whether the sum of your fingers is odd or even (depending on what you chose). 
In this code I have used the random() funcion.
# Module 3: Crypto
In this project I have written methods of encrypting and decrypting text.
I was provided with shiftAlphabet function.
# Module 4: Maze runner
This is a final project in which we have to use the code for maze, that is already provided, and write code to navigate through the given maze.
